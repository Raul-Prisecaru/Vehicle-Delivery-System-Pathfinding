# Delivery System

Delivery System project is used to demonstrate how vehicles would find the most efficient route from it's current position through the use of pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra

## ðŸš€ Features

### Feature  1 - Dynamic Modification
#### You are able to add/modify/remove vertexes and edges as new locations and new roads which vehicle can travel to and access

### Feature 2 - Pathfinding Algorithms
#### You can switch between Dijkstra's and Bellman-ford Pathfinding Algorithms for the vehicle to use

### Feature 3 - Kruskal Algorithm 
#### You can use Kruskal Algorithm to find the least number of edges required to reach every vertex
